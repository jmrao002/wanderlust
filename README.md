# Wanderlust

Built by Michael Rao

A web application that allows users to search for webcams around the world using the Windy Webcams API. Users may also save webcams and view their saved material.

# Technologies Used

# Description

This application allows users to search for webcams around the world using the Windy Webcams API. Users can save individual webcam results to a "Saved" page, where they can, if logged in, reference their saved material at a later time. It is also possible in this application to delete webcams from the "Saved" page. Clicking a "live view" of any wecbam will render an iframe with a live feed natively in the application.
